     <p>Cranberry Brie Bites are a sweet and tangy bite-sized appetizer. Creamy baked brie in a flaky crescent roll cup topped with sweet cranberry orange sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounce <strong>tube crescent roll dough</strong></li>
            <li>flour for rolling out the dough</li>
            <li>6 ounces Brie cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup orange marmalade</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whole cranberry sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped pistachios, pecans, or walnuts</li>
            <li>fresh rosemary or candied orange pieces for garnish</li>

        </ul>

    <h2> Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and grease a 24-count mini-muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Cut the brie into small, about 1-inch (or a little less) squares and set aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together orange marmalade and cranberry sauce. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a flat surface, like a large wooden cutting board, and roll out the tub of crescent dough. Stretch slightly to form an evenly sided rectangle and pinch seams together. Cut into 24 even sized squares.</li>
            <li>Place the squares into the prepared muffin cups. Top with brie cheese square and a teaspoon (or a little less) of the orange-cranberry mixture. Top with a few of the chopped nuts and a small sprig of rosemary.</li>
            <li>Slide the muffin pan into the oven and bake for about 10-13 minutes, or until golden brown and dough is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Let cool 5-10 minutes and serve warm.</li>
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
