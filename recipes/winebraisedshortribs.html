While you can make this dish anytime (and you will probably want to!), we think it’s the perfect meal for a special celebration. When shopping for your beef short ribs, ask your local butcher for the meatiest thickest ones!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds bone-in, beef short ribs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, <em>finely chopped</em></li>
            <li>3 celery ribs, <em>finely chopped</em></li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, <em>peeled, finely chopped</em></li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cups red wine</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
            <li>Finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, for serving</li>
            <li>mashed potatoes, egg noodles or polenta, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the center position.</li>
            <li>Season the short ribs with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once the oil just begins to smoke, working in batches, add the short ribs and cook until browned, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer the ribs to a plate. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pot.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion, celery and carrots, cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Add the tomato paste, stirring to combine. Pour in the wine and stir to incorporate. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and allow the liquid to reduce by ⅓, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return the ribs to the pan along with any collected juices. Add the bay leaves, thyme and beef stock. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, cover the pot and transfer it to the oven. Cook until the ribs are tender and falling off the bone, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Discard the bay leaves and thyme stems. Using tongs, transfer the meat to a serving platter and tent with a foil to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Return the pan to medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a boil. Cook until reduced by about ⅓, 8-10 minutes. Pour the sauce over the meat, season with additional salt and pepper to taste and garnish with parsley. Serve short ribs family-style with mashed potatoes, egg noodles or polenta.</li>
            <li><em>Enjoy!</em></li>
        </ol>
